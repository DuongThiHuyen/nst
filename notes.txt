After considering the teacher's feedback following the presentation on January 7th, our team revisited the study and incorporated several significant modifications.
1. Add FID Metric for Evaluation: FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) is a metric used to evaluate the difference between two feature distributions of images.
Compare style image and output image to evaluate how effectively the style of the style image has been transferred to the output image.
?  Low FID (close to 0):
* A low FID score, such as 0.163, indicates that output image and style image have highly similar features when compared in the feature space of VGG19.
* This means that the neural style transfer model has successfully recreated the style of the style image in the output image.
?  High FID:
* A high FID score would indicate that the output image fails to replicate the style or has significant differences compared to the style image.
2. Exploring the Role of CPU and GPU in Executing Neural Style Transfer Programs
